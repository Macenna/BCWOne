* **Instructions:**

  * In a new HTML file, create the basic structure of an HTML document and include the following in it:

    * DOCTYPE declaration
    <!DOCTYPE html>

    * Head tag with a title tag
    <head>
      <title>This is where the title displayed on the browser is coded.</title>
    </head>

    * H1 tag with a title of your choice
    <body>
      <h1>This is where a website's visually largest header is coded+how.</h1>
    </body>
    *H1 is usually one of the first elements coded w/in the body element.

    * Embed an image
    <body>
      <img src="embedded link" alt(attrbute)="Alternative caption belongs within this attribute">
    </body>
    *images are encoded in the body tag.

    * Create the following three links on your page:
      * One link that is `target="_blank"` so that it opens a new tab when clicked on.
      <body>
        <a href="link" target="_blank">Opens a new tab</a>
      </body>

      * Make the second link bold.
      <body>
        <strong><a href="link here">Bold link</a></strong>
      </body>

      * Make the third link a placeholder so it goes nowhere.
      <body>
        <a href="#">Placeholder link that goes nowhere until a hyperlink is added where the # is.</a>
      </body>

  * HINT: You should be looking up at the screen pretty often :P

  * Bonus:
    * Create an ordered list of steps to make a sandwich.
    * Create an unordered list of 5 bands/musicians you like.
    * Create a table with 2 columns (animal class and animal name) and 4 rows of animals.
    * Use an alternate way of separating links without line breaks.
    * Embed a Youtube video of your favorite band/musician.
